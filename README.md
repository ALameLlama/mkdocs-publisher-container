This repository contains a Dockerized version of `MkDocs`, a static site generator for project documentation, and the `mkdocs-publisher` plugin for enhanced publishing capabilities. The Docker image is designed to simplify hosting and serving MkDocs-based documentation sites with automatic rebuilds and Nginx for serving the generated content.

## Features ‚ú®

- **MkDocs Pre-installed**: A fast, easy-to-use static site generator.
- **MkDocs Publisher Plugin**: Adds advanced publishing functionality.
- **Automatic Rebuilds**: Watch for file changes and rebuild the site automatically.
- **Nginx for Serving**: Uses Nginx to serve the generated site at port 80.
- **Lightweight Image**: Based on the official Python alpine image.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Built for both `amd64` and `arm64`.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Pull the Docker Image

Pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull alamellama/mkdocs-publisher:latest
```

### Build Locally

To build the image locally, clone this repository and run:

```bash
docker build -t mkdocs-publisher .
```

### Run the Container

Serve your MkDocs site with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/app alamellama/mkdocs-publisher
```

- Mount your project directory (with `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/`) to `/app` in the container.
- Access the site at `http://<your-server-ip>` (or `http://localhost` if running locally).

### Automatic Rebuilds

The container watches for changes in your project directory (excluding the `/app/site folder`) and rebuilds the MkDocs site whenever a change is detected. This is done using `inotifywait` with a debounce to prevent continuous rebuilds during rapid file changes.

### Example Directory Structure

Ensure your project is structured like this:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page1.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mkdocs.yml
```

site_url: "https://notes.somecooldomain.au/"
use_directory_urls: false
